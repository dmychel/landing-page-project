# landing-page-project
1st Odin Project:

This project has been an experience. It forced me to have a real understanding of containers and how to use them effectively on a Webpage. I struggled for about 3 days trying to finish this and scrapping my work. When I finally finished I felt pretty decent about it - then I saw the other students' projects... wow. It made me want to come back and redo mine again. But I will keep it for now, I will continue to try and learn more and when I feel I've gained some knowledge I will come back and make this better but with my own font-size and color scheme.
